# DockTweak

DockTweak is an **open-source tool** that helps you **optimize the size and improve the security** of your Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations.

Upload your files and let DockTweak automatically analyze, refactor, and generate improved versions — along with clear reports explaining the changes.

## Key Features

- **Smaller Images**: Reduce final image sizes by smartly optimizing Dockerfiles (base image choices, layer management, etc.)
- **Better Security**: Identify and remove common security risks and unsafe defaults.
- **Detailed Reports**: See exactly what was changed and why — designed to be understandable even for beginners.
- **docker-compose Support**: Improve and harden your docker-compose.yml files.
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent, extensible, and community-driven.
